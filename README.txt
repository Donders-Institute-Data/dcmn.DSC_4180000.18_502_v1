# Abstract

This is a collection of mouse resting-state fMRI datasets collected by Dr. J. Grandjean in two laboratories (ETH Zurich, Singapore Bioimaging Consortium). The datasets were processed using a common pipeline (see Associated analysis tools). The datasets contain both control animals and experimental animals (transgenic models for Alzheimer's disease, chronic stress model for depression).
